What is the correlation coefficient between Neptune's distance from the Sun and US burglary rates?,"The correlation coefficient (r) between Neptune's distance from the Sun and US burglary rates from 1985-2022 is 0.969, with p<0.01 (statistically significant).[1]()[2]()[3]()

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| Correlation Coefficient (r) | 0.969 |
| Coefficient of Determination (r²) | 0.940 |
| P-value | < 0.01 |[1]()[3]()

The coefficient of determination (r² = 0.9396569) indicates that 94% of the change in US burglary rates is predictable based on the change in Neptune's distance from the Sun over the 38 years from 1985 through 2022.[1]()[3]() The 95% correlation confidence interval is [0.94, 0.98].[1]()

While the statistical correlation is extremely strong, it's important to consider the broader context and limitations of such findings. The documentation itself provides important caveats about interpretation.

The p-value (1.5E-23) represents the probability of finding a correlation this extreme by random chance. To put this in perspective, if correlating 65,334,709,717,884,718,809,088 random variables with 37 degrees of freedom, one would randomly expect to find a correlation as strong as this one.[1]()

Several critical limitations should be considered when interpreting this strong statistical correlation:

The analysis notes specific concerns including:
1. Data dredging: With 25,153 variables in the database and 632,673,409 correlation calculations, this approach involves comparing all variables to find random matches rather than testing a specific hypothesis.[6]()

2. Lack of causal connection: There is probably no direct connection between these variables, particularly since 'Years' was used as the base variable rather than a more specific unit of study like 'one person'.[6]()

3. Observations not independent: Sequential years are not independent of each other, as populations tend to maintain consistent behavior across time rather than making sudden changes on January 1.[6]()",Does the response accurately extract specific numerical data from the documents?,3.219

"What are the four main reasons why spurious correlations work, according to the Tyler Vigen documents?","| # | Reason for Spurious Correlations | Explanation |
|---|--------------------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Data Dredging | With 25,153 variables in the database, comparing all against each other yields 632,673,409 correlation calculations. This approach, instead of starting with a hypothesis, abuses data to find random correlations. Any sufficiently large dataset will yield strong correlations completely at random [1]() |
| 2 | Lack of Causal Connection | There is probably no direct connection between variables, especially when using 'Years' as the base variable. Many yearly events are unrelated to each other, and most studies would use 'one person' instead of 'one year' as the unit of study [1]() |
| 3 | Observations Not Independent | Sequential years are not independent of each other. When populations continuously perform daily activities, there's no reason to expect sudden changes on January 1. Simple p-value calculations don't account for this, making results appear less probable than they really are [1]() |
