      "Rishi Sunak, who served as the United Kingdom’s prime minister from 2022 to 2024, has taken on senior advisory roles at Microsoft and Anthropic, [The Guardian reports](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/09/rishi-sunak-takes-advisory-roles-with-microsoft-and-ai-firm-anthropic).\n",
      "\n",
      "[Letters](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sunak-rishi-prime-minister-acoba-advice) from the Parliament’s office of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba) disclosing Sunak’s appointments revealed concerns that the ex-Conservative PM’s privileged information could “grant Microsoft an unfair advantage.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sunak has some history with Microsoft, which has several active contracts with British government departments. In 2023, he unveiled a £2.5 billion deal with Microsoft to invest in new data centers and training in the U.K.\n",
      "\n",
      "Acoba also [noted](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sunak-rishi-prime-minister-acoba-advice/advice-letter-rishi-sunak-senior-advisor-anthropic-pbc) that “there is a reasonable concern that your appointment could be seen to offer unfair access and influence within the U.K. government…given the ongoing debate about how to best regulate AI, and at a time of intense debate and lobbying around the world on what the approach should be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sunak said he would steer clear on advising on U.K. policy matters, stick to high-level perspectives on macro-economic and geopolitical trends, and avoid lobbying. He said he would divert his salary to the Richmond Project, a charity he founded with his wife earlier this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The former PM also serves as a senior advisor to investment bank Goldman Sachs and speech writer for firms like Bain Capital and Makena Capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sunak isn’t the first British politician to take on roles helping Silicon Valley tech giants navigate governmental affairs. Sunak’s senior political adviser, Liam Booth-Smith, is also on Anthropic’s payroll. And former Liberal Democrat Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg served as Meta’s president of global affairs until January 2025.\n",

      "*   The launch comes just weeks after Anthropic announced Claude Sonnet 4.5 in September and Claude Opus 4.1 in August.\n",

      "\n",
      "[Anthropic](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/anthropic-cnbc-disruptor-50.html) on Wednesday announced Claude Haiku 4.5, a small [artificial intelligence](https://www.cnbc.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/) model that's available as a lower-cost offering for all of the company's users.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is fast and can outperform other larger models that were considered cutting edge just months ago, Anthropic said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Claude Haiku 4.5 is better at using computers than [Claude Sonnet 4](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/22/claude-4-opus-sonnet-anthropic.html), for instance, which is a midsized model the company launched in May. It performs similarly to Claude Sonnet 4 and OpenAI's most recent model, [GPT-5](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/07/openai-launches-gpt-5-model-for-all-chatgpt-users.html), at coding, according to SWE-bench Verified, a test set that measures an AI system's software coding abilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It punches way above its weight,\" Mike Krieger, Anthropic's chief product officer, told CNBC in an interview.\n",
      "\n",
      "Claude Haiku 4.5 is available to Anthropic's free users, and it's now the cheapest model available to paid users.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jaque Silva | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n",
      "\n",
      "Anthropic is an [AI startup](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/02/anthropic-raises-13-billion-at-18-billion-valuation.html) that develops a family of large language models called Claude. The company assigns new numbers to the models as they advance across generations, but the smallest model in the family is typically called Haiku, the midsized model is called Sonnet and the largest model is Opus.\n",
      "\n",
      "After OpenAI burst onto the scene with the launch of its [chatbot ChatGPT](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/14/walmart-openai-chatgpt-shopping.html) in 2022, Anthropic launched a rival product, Claude, the following year. It's powered by Anthropic's family of models, and users can choose between free and paid tiers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The launch of Claude Haiku 4.5 comes just weeks after the company announced [Claude Sonnet 4.5 i](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/29/anthropic-claude-ai-sonnet-4-5.html)n September and [Claude Opus 4.1](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-1) in August. Anthropic is working to release another model, likely an updated version of Opus, by the end of this year or early next year, Krieger said.\n",
      "\n",
      "For paid users, Haiku models are typically around one-third of the cost of Anthropic's Sonnet models, while Sonnet models are one-fifth of the cost of its Opus models, Krieger said. Anthropic's free users can still choose to use Claude Sonnet 4.5, but they'll get more capacity out of Claude Haiku 4.5 since it's smaller, he added.\n",

      "The two models can also work together. Anthropic said Claude Sonnet 4.5 can create multi-step plans to solve complex problems, and Claude Haiku 4.5 can complete subtasks within those plans, for example.\n",
      "\n",
      "Running the models in parallel could be particularly useful for businesses that want to use AI to tackle longer-term projects, Krieger said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You could have Haiku monitoring financial streams of data – and because it's a smaller, cheaper, faster model, it can do that at a higher volume – and then pass off its early insights to Sonnet to do some deeper analysis,\" he said.\n",

Following the launch of GPT-5 in August, OpenAI has inked several [multibillion-dollar](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/22/nvidia-openai-data-center.html) infrastructure deals and released a short-form video app called [Sora](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/09/openais-sora-downloads.html).\n",
      "\n",
      "The breakneck pace of the industry doesn't afford Anthropic much time to get comfortable after a launch. While the company was carrying out the training for Claude Sonnet 4.5, it had already kicked off work on Claude Haiku 4.5.\n",
